TMT Agent Assisted Data Science Project

This project provides a simple framework to download datasets from Kaggle or use local datasets, 
train popular scikit-learn models, and save the results. It is structured using an agent-based 
architecture to allow for future expansion into a multi-agent data science platform.

This is meant to be an assistive tool for supervised AI-enhanced data science in building 
datasets building models, making discoveries and perhaps even publishing reports and also  
for people like me who need to budget limited time and have too many other interests to engage.
